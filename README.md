# Exploring customer churn at SyriaTel


## Introduction

Import, explore, clean, standardize, and model SyriaTel's dataset with a logistic regression to classify whether or not customers are about to churn.

We want to know the underlying influencers on churn, and how they can be adjusted in order to better predict churn. Such metrics would include p-values associated with the various features, and comparing models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Import the Dataset
2. Explore the Dataset
3. Visualize the Dataset with a Confusion Matrix.

## Hypotheses
Alternative Hypothesis:
There is a multivariate relationship between the feartures in the dataset, and the churn rate.

Null Hypothesis:
There is no relationship between these variables.

## Methodology and Approach 
This will be a supervised learning task with a plain batch. Instances are labeled with classification values corresponding to a target variable. 

## Performance Measure
For this logistic regression analysis, I will be using the ROC curve and AUC score to get an idea of how much error my model makes in its classifications.
